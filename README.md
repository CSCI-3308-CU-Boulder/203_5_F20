What is this?

This project is a multiplayer online game that see people connecting to a host executable by means of their own browsers and competing in a "quote game," with each player making their best guess as to who said the prompt quote! In a year like 2020, having accessible outlets to play games with friends, no matter the distance, is vital and this game is another way to do this!

How do I run it?


How do I play?

On the host side,

On the player side, go to http://ttgames.us/ and fill in the forms: choose a nickname, and type in the game code displayed on the host's screen. This should bring you to a waiting room with the rest of the players until the host starts uo the game! Once the game starts, a quote will be displayed with 4 possible answers as to who said it. Make your vote by selecting on your browser. If you got it right, you get a point! Once the host ends the game, the player with the most points wins!
